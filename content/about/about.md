## Hello!

My name is Ujjwal Sarswat, and I tinker with tech, usually.

This site is a place where I can experiment, blog, and occasionally break things. My number one favourite thing to do is challenge myself to learn new things, so if you have an interesting project in mind, please let me know about it.

If something on here looks like hot garbage, or you just want to ask me something that wonâ€™t irreparably damage my self-esteem, you can contact me at [ujjwalsarswat1@gmail.com](mailto:ujjwalsarswat1@gmail.com).

Feel free to sign me up for as many spam mailing lists as you like, I can take it.

## What do I do, specifically?

Oh, you want details? Sure.

Currently, I am a Python Toolchain Developer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com), working on the, you guessed it, [Toolchains](https://elvira.canonical.com/toolchains) team. The team primarily focuses on enhancing developer experience on Ubuntu. More of my history [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ujjwal-sarswat).

## Current headspace occupiers

I am (trying to) write a [driver](https://github.com/vmpyr/hid-shanwan) for a cheap chinese gamepad by capturing and understanding its USB packet data. I am also learning more about cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs and kindle modding.

## Other interests

I am an avid Formula 1 fan (unfortunately, cheering for Ferrari). I also enjoy reading, music and video games with my friends.

_Do with all of this information what you will._
