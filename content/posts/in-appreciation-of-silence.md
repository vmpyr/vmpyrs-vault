## What is Silence?
A week of solitary existence forces one to ponder silence and loneliness. But what really is silence? Is it simply the absence of noise? Or is it something far deeper, an intangible presence that speaks in ways words never could?

One can often misinterpret silence as loneliness, yet it holds an aura that very few can appreciate. A blank canvas is to art what silence is to the richest of thoughts. A conundrum lies in the fact that silence forces you to ponder upon itself. Silence allows one to hear the whispers of the soul that are otherwise drowned out by the chaos of everyday life.

## When it hurts
Silence isn't always serene however. It can be an invisible force that pushes one to face their innermost thoughts. Confrontation with oneself is never easy. Self-doubt is magnified, regrets punch harder and desires burn more blazingly. Once, however, if one embraces rather than resist, silence can transform that void into a dimension of peace, clarity and understanding. Acceptance becomes the norm, mistakes seem human and the ego is dwarfed. This duality of silence is what makes it so much more difficult to understand.

## The Light
In today's day and age, where artificial sounds permeate every waking moment, true silence has become a rare and almost foreign experience. However, for those who are able to tackle its duality, experience the terrifying yet transformative power of silence. Be it in the hush of a library, or nature's vast stillness, silence isn't the dark tunnel, it is the light at the end of it.

Perhaps, then, silence is not the absence of something but the presence of everything that truly matters, waiting to be heard.
